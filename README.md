What is it
----------------------------------------------------------------
gomediatracker is a web app to track your phsyical media collection.
I use server made in Go that serves the HTML pages and handles http requests. The frontend is very minimal just using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. The JS is used mostly to communicate with the server to retrieve data
and render the data on the html pages.
